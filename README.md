Hi..
This Small project is my first ever project to be published in GitHub. This project is an Html , Css project , which is about a google homepage  .
In this project , most of the languages used were HTML and Css, the challenge here was , the position of each icon , buttons , image etc.. at the correct place. I had to know the difference between padding, margin , and so on. How to put a div in a center place , give it a shadow-box and all. 
here in this repository , you reader will find an index file and a style file where all the Html and css code have been written .
Hope it will be more clear for everyone to read and understand.
